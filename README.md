# ExampleProject

Example web app, that allows everyone to publish some posts and images (divided)
Doesnt have any authentication disabled cross-site scripting or js/html injection .YET.

Structure is based on MVP, even though I used naming scheme for MVC lol
Basic routing is very similiar to what Laravel has to offer (Route::get, Route::post)
