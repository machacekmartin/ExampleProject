# ExampleProject

Example web app, that allows everyone to publish some posts and images (divided)

Doesnt have any authentication. YET

Cross-site scripting and js/html injection not taken care of. YET


Structure is based on MVP, even though I used naming scheme for MVC lol

Basic routing is very similiar to what Laravel has to offer (Route::get, Route::post)
